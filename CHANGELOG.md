All notable changes to the Dakera deployment configurations will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Security — SA-2026-001 (Critical)

Three critical insecure-default vulnerabilities were found in the default Docker Compose configuration
and fixed in [dakera-deploy PR #1](https://github.com/Dakera-AI/dakera-deploy/pull/1).

**Affected versions:** v0.1.0 and any deployment using the default `docker-compose.yml` without
overriding the affected variables.

**Vulnerabilities fixed:**

1. **Auth disabled by default** (`DAKERA_AUTH_ENABLED=false`): The default Compose config shipped
   with authentication disabled, leaving the API open with no key enforcement. Fixed: default is
   now `true`; the env var is also required (startup fails if unset).

2. **Public MinIO bucket**: The `minio-setup` init container set the storage bucket policy to
   anonymous download (`mc anonymous set download`), exposing all stored vector data to
   unauthenticated reads. Fixed: anonymous access policy removed.

3. **Hardcoded dev API key fallback** (`dk_dev_root_key_change_in_production`): The root API key
   fell back to a well-known dev string if not overridden. Fixed: the variable is now required with
   no default; containers refuse to start until a real key is supplied in `.env`.

**Action required for existing deployments:**

See [Security Advisory SA-2026-001](https://github.com/Dakera-AI/dakera-docs/blob/main/SECURITY.md#sa-2026-001)
in dakera-docs for the full advisory, impact assessment, and remediation steps.
